My name is Mathias Jean Johansen. I live in [Copenhagen,
Denmark](https://osm.org/go/0NWvCr9--) where I am currently pursuing a master's
degree in Games at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk).

I've a penchant for the web, esoteric, hobby programming languages, and [open
source software](https://github.com/majjoha). When I am not writing code, I
enjoy traveling, reading books, playing and listening to music.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:mathias@mjj.io)
([GPG](https://keybase.io/majjoha/key.asc)), or
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/majjoha). I can also often be found idling on
[`irc.freenode.net`](irc://irc.freenode.net/majjoha,isnick) as `majjoha`.
