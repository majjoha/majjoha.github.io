My name is Mathias Jean Johansen. I work as a Software Engineer at
[Zendesk](https://zendesk.com) in [Copenhagen,
Denmark](https://goo.gl/maps/KnZnt).

I find the numerous facets of the web, programming languages, and open source
software immensely compelling.

When I am not writing code, I enjoy
[reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22173445-mathias) and [listening
to music](http://www.last.fm/user/bouleau).

You can reach me via [mail](mailto:mathias@mjj.io),
