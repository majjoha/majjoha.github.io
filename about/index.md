Hi, I’m Mathias. I live in [Copenhagen,
Denmark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen), where I currently work as
an engineering manager at [the LEGO Group](https://www.lego.com). Prior to that,
I graduated from the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk) with a
bachelor’s degree in Software Development and a master’s degree in Games.

I have a penchant for functional programming, reading, [open source
software](https://github.com/majjoha), and playing and listening to music.

If you want to reach out to me, please send me an
[email](mailto:mathias@mjj.io).
