My name is Mathias Jean Johansen. I live in [Copenhagen,
Denmark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen) where I also obtained my
master's degree in Games from the [IT University of
Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk).

I have a penchant for the web, unconventional computing, and [open source
software](https://github.com/majjoha). When I am not writing code, I enjoy
traveling, reading books, playing and listening to music.

If you want to get in touch, you can reach me via
[email](mailto:mathias@mjj.io), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/majjoha).
