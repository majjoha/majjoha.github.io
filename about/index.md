Hi, I'm Mathias. I live in [Copenhagen,
Denmark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen) where I also
[recently](/now) obtained my master's degree in Games from the [IT University of
Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk).

I have a penchant for the web, reading, [open source
software](https://github.com/majjoha), [lists](/lists), and playing and
listening to music.

If you want to reach out to me, please send me an
[e-mail](mailto:mathias@mjj.io).
