My name is Mathias Jean Johansen. I currently live in [Copenhagen,
Denmark](https://goo.gl/maps/KnZnt) where I write software for a living.

I've a penchant for the web, esoteric, hobby programming languages, open source
software, and computer and Internet history.

When I am not writing code, I enjoy traveling,
[reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22173445-mathias), playing and
[listening](http://www.last.fm/user/bouleau) to music.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:mathias@mjj.io)
([GPG](https://keybase.io/majjoha/key.asc)),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/majjoha), or
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/majjoha). I can also often be found idling on
[`irc.freenode.net`](irc://irc.freenode.net/majjoha,isnick) as `majjoha`.
