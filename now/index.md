After successfully defending my master's thesis in January, I am now enjoying a
hiatus before I'll eventually return to work. Some of this time, I spend
dabbling in Erlang and reading [Learn You Some Erlang for Great
Good](https://learnyousomeerlang.com), rewatching [Curb Your
Enthusiasm](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264235/) and tinkering.
