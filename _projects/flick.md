Flick is an extremely simple, analog game. In order to play Flick, you need at
least four players. The four persons are divided into two teams with two players
on each team. You can play with more than two teams as you please.

The core mechanic of Flick is *flicking*. The two players of the team take
turns, and flick a cap between them in order to progress towards the end of the
playing field.

### Rules and mechanics
- The objective of the game is to reach the end of the playing field. The team
  that reaches the end of the playing field with the fewest amount of points
  wins.
- You are awarded one point for each move. You receive two points if you drop
  the cap.
- You cannot progress through the playing field if the cap is dropped. Your
  partner needs to catch the flick before you can move.
- You are only allowed to flick the cap with two fingers in one hand; throwing
  the cap is not allowed.
- The player who carries the cap cannot move.
- The player who needs to catch the cap decides how far he/she wants to move.
- Players are only allowed to move along their own line of the playing field.
- A game consists of a minimum of two rounds, i.e. one round per team. One round
  takes approximately five minutes.
- The teams take turns; only one team plays at a time. Once a team starts a
  round, they need to finish it before the other team can play.
- The playing field is 15 meters long, and the width of the playing field
  increases from two meters in the beginning of the area to four meters at the
  goal of the playing field forming a cone-shaped area.

A round of Flick can be illustrated with a primitive animation. The U-shaped
area is the playing field, and the two circles indicate the players. The blue
circle indicates the player flicking the cap, and the gray circle indicates the
player catching the cap.

### Iterations
The core concept of Flick was developed around the verb "flicking". It evolved
over a set of many short iterations before we settled on the eventual mechanics
of the game. Briefly described, these iterations were:

1. Two teams with two players on each team play against each other. One player
   from team A flicks the cap towards the second player from the same team who
   has to catch the cap in a basket. Both players from team B try to interfere
   during the exchange.
2. The second proposal featured the same team structure. Inspired by American
   football, it is a slightly more physical game where you have to carry the cap
   to your goal.
3. Our third iteration was almost identical to our final game prototype. It
   consists of the same rules as Flick, but has a straight playing field
   instead.

### Reflections 
As with many games, Flick has weaknesses too. The most important one is that the
game is entirely based on skills, and it contains no random elements.
Consequently, the game will not create a lot of tension if the prowess of the
two teams vastly differs. Once a team is far ahead, there is a little the other
team can do to catch up. Since the goal of the game is to reach the end of the
playing field in as few flicks as possible, there is an incentive to go for
longer flicks between the players on the team. This benefits the game by
introducing an element of risk/reward, e.g. go for longer flicks, and
potentially be penalized for it (if your partner does not catch the cap).
Furthermore, we recognized that spectators may particularly enjoy watching the
game when players are forced to go for riskier flicks to catch up.

Flick was developed in collaboration with Mads Engberg, Steffen Kj√¶rgaard
Nielsen, and Victor Olsson.
