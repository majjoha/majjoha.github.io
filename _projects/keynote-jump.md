Keynote Jump is an infinite, vertical jumping game for one player. The game is
centered around a single game loop with jumping as its sole focus. Keynote Jump
is an exploration of game feel, and it particularly explores the physics of
jumping and its effects on game feel. To further support the feel of the game,
Keynote Jump provides musical feedback every time a platform is hit.

Your avatar is a musical note which can be moved left or right with the arrow
keys.

### Objective
There is no objective.

### Rules
While the game does not offer a score, and it is not inherently competitive, you
should aim to reach the top.
