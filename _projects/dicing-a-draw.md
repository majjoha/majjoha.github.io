Dicing a Draw is a party game for three to five players. It consists of a deck
of action cards, and a die.

Similarly to poker, Dicing a Draw features primarily agôn since the game is
heavily competitive, and it relies on the player's ability to memorize a
sequence of actions. Furthermore, the game has hints of alea though this is
fairly limited. On the continuum of ludus, and paidia, Dicing a Draw places
itself on the side of ludus, as it is a structured activity with rather explicit
rules.

### Objective
The objective of the game is to stay alive. The person who survives for the
longest wins the game.

### Rules
- Five stacks of cards are placed on a table. Each stack represents a side of a
  die from one to five. In the beginning of a game of Dicing a Draw, all five
  stacks are allocated one card with a rule which is read aloud to the other
  players.
- Players take turns clockwise. Every turn, the player rolls a die.
- If the player rolls a six, he or she draws a rule from the stack of cards,
  reads it aloud to the other players, rolls the die again, and assigns the rule
  to the stack corresponding to the number on the die.
- If the player rolls a number from one to five, he or she has to perform the
  sequence of actions corresponding to the stack of cards for the number on the
  die. The player cannot look at the cards, and thus needs to rely on his or her
  memory. If the player fails to perform the actions in the proper sequence, or
  only performs a few of the actions, he or she loses a life. Once the player
  has lost three lives, he or she is out.
