The Abyss is an infinite, two-player platform game. Drawing upon Caillois' four
categories of games, The Abyss explores the notion of *ag√¥n* (competition) by
having two players battle each other for survival. The player who manages to
avoid the abyss wins. The game also exercises the idea of *alea* (chance) by
randomly generating platforms of disparate behavior, and thus partly leaving the
survival of the player to luck. The game features the following platforms:

- Black platforms are static but disappear after a few seconds.
- Green platforms move either up, down, left, or right.
- Purple platforms swap the positions of the two players.
- Red platforms instantly kill you.
- Blue platforms bounce the player.
- Orange platforms shrink over time.

Player one can be controlled with the <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd>, and
<kbd>w</kbd> keys for moving left, right, and jumping, respectively, while
player two similarly uses <kbd>&#9664;</kbd>, <kbd>&#9658;</kbd>, and
<kbd>&#9650;</kbd> for moving left, right, and jumping.

### Rules and mechanics
- The objective of the game is to stay alive. In order to survive, you need to
  avoid the abyss by jumping on the different platforms.
- You are awarded one point when the opposite player hits the abyss. This marks
  the end of the round.
- Since The Abyss is an infinite game, you decide how many rounds you want to
  play.
