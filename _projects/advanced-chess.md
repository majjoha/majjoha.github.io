Advanced Chess is a modification of
[chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess). The rules are nearly identical to
chess. It features two players, and every piece operates in the same fashion as
regular chess. The game, however, offers multiple play modes:

- Normal mode is essentially regular chess. It does not differ from chess in any
  way.
- Shuffle mode features the same pieces as regular chess but at random
  positions.
- Random mode randomizes both the starting location of the pieces, and the
  pieces themselves, e.g., the player can have two queens.
- Adventure mode adapts an army versus army-scenario where two armies battle
  each other until one team has lost all units. Starting positions are
  predetermined by which mode you choose. Adventure mode features four modes:
  "Horsing Around", "Enemy Surrounded", "Queen's Gambit", and "Save the Queen".

Shuffle, and Random mode both contribute with a layer of unpredictability that
even the most adept chess players will have to adapt to. Alea is clearly at
play, but the game still mainly focuses on ag√¥n since Advanced Chess is largely
competitive. Furthermore, the game places itself on the side of ludus due to its
heavily rule-based nature.

### Rules and mechanics
- As in ordinary chess, a player must checkmate the opponent by outmaneuvering
  him or her into a position where the king is powerless to free himself. This
  will result in a win.
- In Adventure mode, the goal is to defeat your opponent by killing all the
  enemy units.
- Each player has 16 pieces (king, queen, tower, knight, bishop, or pawn) for
  all modes except Adventure mode.
