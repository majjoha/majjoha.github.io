Dolphy is an incredibly small (~200 LOC) web framework written in
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and based on
[Rack](https://rack.github.io). It was originally mimicking the behavior of
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com), but as time has passed, it has slightly
changed direction and is now more of a mix between different web frameworks.
