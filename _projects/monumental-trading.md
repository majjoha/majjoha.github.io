Monumental Trading is a competitive board game for two players designed around
bluffing and strategic use of limited resources. 

### Objective
The objective of Monumental Trading is to build a given monument before the
opponent.

### Board and cards
Before delving into the rules of Monumental Trading, a brief overview of the
elements of the game is needed.

The deck of resources contains the following cards:
- Stone (6 cards)
- Marble (6 cards)
- Clay (6 cards)
- Iron (6 cards)
- Gems (3 cards)
- Gold (3 cards)

The deck of action cards contains one of each of the following cards:
1. Movement
- Wind: Both boats move forward one extra tile.
- Heat: Both boats remain grounded for one turn.
- Stranded: One boat remains in port for one turn.
- Lost: One boat moves backward one tile.

2. Cargo
- Pirates: One boat loses one resource of choice.
- Reserve: One boat receives an extra resource of choice.
- Storm: Both boats lose all their resources.
- Swap: Both boats exchange cargo between them.

3. Port
- Thieves: One resource of choice from the port is discarded.
- Mistake: One resource of choice from the port is replaced with another.

The monument deck contains the following cards:
- The Great Pyramid of Giza (3 stone, 2 clay, 1 iron)
- Hanging Gardens of Babylon (1 marble, 1 glass, 2 gold)
- Temple of Artemis (3 marble, 1 glass, 1 gem)
- Statue of Zeus at Olympia (1 marble, 1 clay, 2 gold)
- Mausoleum at Harlicarnassus (3 clay, 1 glass, 2 iron)
- Colossus of Rhodes (2 marble, 2 glass, 1 gem)
- Lighthouse of Alexandria (2 stone, 2 glass, 2 iron)

Apart from the cards, the game contains a board and two boat pieces. 

### Rules
The game board consists of two ports one belonging to each player. The two ports
are divided by two sea tiles. Two boat pieces are placed in each port at the
beginning of the game. As shown below, the blue tiles are sea tiles, while beige
tiles illustrate ports.

As the game starts, each player draws three resource cards, three action cards,
and one monument card. There are two types of resources; rare and common
resources. The rare resources appear half as many times in the deck of resources
as the common resource cards. The resources are necessary in order to build
monuments. Building a monument is the objective of the game, and the player
needs to load their boat with resource cards, and successfully unload them in
the opponent's port. Once all the resources listed on the monument card has been
unloaded in the opponent's port, the monument card is revealed, and the player
with the newly built monument wins.

Monument cards list required elements. In the monument card shown below, stone,
glass, and iron are required to build the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

Action cards allow the player to change the flow of the game. Actions can affect
the movement or cargo of one or more boats, or alter the content of a port.
Action cards are drawn at the beginning of the game, and the action card shown
below affects the cargo of the boat.

Monumental Trading is divided into turns. Each player takes turns alternating
between player one and two. Player one starts. The turn goes as follows:
- Discard all unwanted resource cards into the discard pile face up.
- Draw until there are three resource cards in hand.
- (Optional) Load boats in the port with one resource card face up.
- (Optional) Play an action card.

After each player's turn, both boats move one tile towards the opposing port. If
they reach a port, they unload their resource cards into the port face down.
Boats will not leave a port if the owning player has not had a turn to load
them.

If the deck of resource cards is exhausted, all discarded resource cards will be
shuffled and become the new deck of resource cards.

### Balance
Monumental Trading was designed to give players a feeling that their decisions
affect the outcome of the game, and thus it lends itself to agôn while still
containing a significant element of alea. The monument cards, action cards, and
resource cards were designed to allow the player to develop a strategy with an
array of options that seemed sensible.

While one may feel tempted to always load the resources that the monument card
requires, loading resources which are not required for the monument could trick
the opponent into wasting action cards on these, and since action cards are
limited to the three cards drawn at the beginning of the game, this might be a
beneficial strategy.

In addition, there is also a memory element to the game which is introduced by
the resource cards. As resource cards are only face up as they are shipped or
discarded, this can lead to further confusion when trying to guess what monument
card the opponent has, and thus rewards a keen memory.

Finally, the monuments were also carefully considered when balancing the game.
The monuments were designed so that each resource card was used almost as
frequently across all monuments in order to avoid that any resource cards would
deem universally useless. The role of rare resources was also considered. All
monument cards require between four and six resources each. Monument cards that
require six resources do not require any rare resources. Monument cards that
require four and five resource cards, however, require two and one rare
resource(s), respectively. From this design, a risk-reward element is
introduced, since one rare resource counts as two regular resource cards.
Successfully shipping a required rare resource will be the equivalent of
shipping two regular resource cards, but similarly using an action to prevent
the opponent from shipping a rare resource will set them back just as much.
