Dots & Lines is an agonistic, single-player game. It consists of a single game
loop centered around the mechanic of the transmitting messages in order to
defeat enemies in the grid. Messages are transmitted as Morse codes by pressing
the space bar. Coordinates are inputted as a letter followed by a number, i.e.,
the lower left position in the grid can be targeted by transmitting the message
"A1".

### Objective
The objective of Dots & Lines is to stay alive for a long as possible. In
addition, Dots & Lines provides a score which competitive players may draw their
attention to, as it can act as a secondary objective.

### Rules
- Coordinates are transmitted as Morse code by hitting the space bar.
- No more than three, red enemies can occupy cells in the grid simultaneously.

While the game primarily lends itself to agôn, Dots & Lines contains elements of
vertigo when many enemies appear on the grid. It follows the tradition of
ludus-oriented games due to its structured nature, and explicit rules.
