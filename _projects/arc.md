Arc is a competitive, single-player game. It can be seen as an amalgam of
collectible card games, and classic shoot 'em up titles. In the game, the player
cycles through three distinct loops which we will briefly touch upon.

### Craft cards
In this loop, materials collected in the battle screen can be combined into
cards. Cards are crafted from recipes that describe which materials are needed.
Each card modifies the behavior of the spaceship which the player controls on
the battle screen. A card may, for instance, increase the health of the
spaceship.

### Build deck
Once the player has created their cards, they can then form a deck of maximum
three cards. According to Sid Meier, a game is a series of interesting choices,
and in this loop, Arc allows the player to explore various choices and
combinations. The cards can be of any type meaning that the player can opt for
cards that only increase speed if he or she so pleases.

### Battle
This scene essentially contains a primitive shoot 'em up game where the deck is
affecting the behavior of the spaceship. As the player progresses through the
screen, the difficulty of the game increases. Materials which can be used for
crafting new cards are spawned randomly throughout the level. The spaceship is
controlled with the arrow keys, and you can shoot asteroids by pressing the
space bar.

The aforementioned, three loops form the following structure:

### Objective
The objective of the game is to stay alive for as long as possible. Every time,
an asteroid hits you, your health decreases. If your health level reaches zero,
then the game ends.

### Rules
Arc features few rules.

- You can only craft cards if you have the necessary materials but you are free
  to craft multiple instances of the same card.
- You can only select three cards in your deck. However, you are free to opt for
  fewer cards or none if you prefer. Similarly, the game does not restrict how
  many cards of the same type you decide to use.

The game features elements from both agôn, and alea. Agôn is predominantly
explored through the competitive nature of the game, as the player constantly
struggles to stay alive. Additionally, Arc delves into the notion of alea
through the randomly spawned materials in the battle screen. Arc places itself
on the side of ludus on the continuum of ludus, and paidia, as it is mainly a
structured activity with explicit rules.

The loop closeness in the game is quite close, as each loop is closely related.
For instance, it seems reasonable to move directly from the deck building loop,
once the player has crafted their cards. In terms of loop speed, each loop has a
distinct length. Competent players may quickly craft cards, and assemble a deck,
but spend a lot of time in the battle scene, while inexperienced players may
carefully consider their deck before they start a new battle.
