This post is simply a reminder to myself of all the great things that have
happened during 2015.

### Highlights
- In many ways, 2015 was a year of JavaScript to me. I visited my first
  conference, [ReactEurope](https://www.react-europe.org), and went to a React
  hackathon at the Mozilla office in Paris. In addition, I spent countless hours
  learning [Flow](http://flowtype.org/), and implementing it into our existing
  code base at work. I also familiarized myself with the wonders of
  [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), and ECMAScript 2015, and I learned to apply, and
  appreciate the ideas behind [JSON schemas](https://brandur.org/elegant-apis).
- I submitted, and successfully defended my [bachelor's
  thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g138w9klyneuajy/Mads-Mathias-Bachelor-Thesis.pdf?dl=0).
  This is possibly the most challenging work I've accomplished so far. It is an
  implementation of a lazy, functional programming language which can be
  executed on two, separate stack machines that perform lazy evaluation using
  two different strategies. It consists of a compiler written in OCaml, and the
  aforementioned stack machines written in C. The source code is available on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/majjoha/sloth), although sufficient documentation
  is still severely lacking.

### Books read
Compared to 2014, I've read far fewer books in 2015 than I wanted to both in
terms of fiction, and technical books. In 2016, I hope to delve into Tropic of
Capricorn, Flaubert, and ideally also SICP which has been on my to-read list
since the beginning of 2014. These are the books I completed in 2015 in
chronological order:

- [Simon Reynolds: Rip it Up and Start Again](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272642.Rip_it_Up_and_Start_Again)
- [Charles Bukowski: Ham on Rye](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38501.Ham_on_Rye)
- [Simon L. Peyton Jones: The Implementation Of Functional Programming
  Languages](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3652866-the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages)
- [Paul Auster: The New York Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/486623.The_New_York_Trilogy)
- [Gabriel García Márquez: Memories of My Melancholy Whores](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/760.Memories_of_My_Melancholy_Whores)
- [William S. Burroughs: Junky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4517763-junky)
- [Miran Lipovača: Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9282423-learn-you-a-haskell-for-great-good)


### Favorite records of the year
[I've listed](http://www.last.fm/user/bouleau/journal) my favorite records of
the year for quite some years now. This year is no different.

1. [Julia Holter: Have You In My
   Wilderness](http://www.allmusic.com/album/have-you-in-my-wilderness-mw0002860296)
2. [Horsebeach: II](http://www.allmusic.com/album/ii-mw0002869328)
3. [Father John Misty: I Love You, Honeybear](http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-love-you-honeybear-mw0002777404)
4. [Jim O'Rourke: Simple
   Songs](http://www.allmusic.com/album/simple-songs-mw0002835921)
5. [Mark McGuire: Beyond Belief](http://www.allmusic.com/album/beyond-belief-mw0002884480)
6. [Beach House: Depression Cherry](http://www.allmusic.com/album/depression-cherry-mw0002860587)
7. [Gun Outfit: Dream All Over](http://www.allmusic.com/album/dream-all-over-mw0002877974)
8. [James Blackshaw: Summoning Suns](http://www.allmusic.com/album/summoning-suns-mw0002812289)
9. [Loren Connors: Blues: The Dark Paintings of "Mark Rothko"](http://www.allmusic.com/album/blues-the-dark-paintings-of-mark-rothko-mw0002807887)
10. [The Necks: Vertigo](http://www.allmusic.com/album/vertigo-mw0002877481)

I have a slight feeling that 2016 will include working with
[Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), and
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org). If time permits it, it would be
interesting to dabble in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
[Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/), [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/), and
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), or even notably older programming languages
as [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), and
[Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)).

Hopefully, I'll have more time to practice music too, and perhaps travel a bit
as well. I'd also be fun to revisit my bachelor's thesis, and refine the
language. I might give an update on the state of affairs next year. We'll see.

Here's to 2016!
