title:  "Kinesis Advantage Macros"

While I was visiting the US in July, I bought a Kinesis Advantage keyboard, and
it has been one of the better investments I've done lately. Not only is it
extremely comfortable to use, but it is also easily configurable through its
remapping and macro system. Some keys, however, do not behave the way I would
expect them to by default on OS X. One of these keys is the <kbd>PrintScr</kbd>
key, but you can solve it almost effortlessly via a macro. You need to do the
following:

* Press and hold <kbd>Program</kbd> and <kbd>F11/Macro</kbd> (lights on keyboard
  will flash repeatedly).
* Press and release the macro trigger, in this case, <kbd>PrintScr</kbd>
  (flashing lights should slow down).
* Type your macro. Press and hold <kbd>Cmd</kbd>, then <kbd>Shift</kbd>, and as
  you are holding both down, tap the <kbd>3</kbd> key and release.
* Exit by repeating step 1 (lights should stop flashing).

If you prefer to take screenshots of specific areas of the screen, you might
want to map this to <kbd>Cmd</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>4</kbd> instead.
