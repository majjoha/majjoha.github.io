I spend many hours daily in Vim, and I've grown extremely fond of the way I can
easily navigate things with <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, and
<kbd>l</kbd>. This have also led me to download and use the [Vimium
plugin](http://vimium.github.io/) for Chrome quite extensively.  The Vimium
plugin is so good that I rarely have to touch my Magic Trackpad anymore.

There is one problem, however. I tend to spend a fair amount of time reading
documents and books in the Preview.app on my Mac which by default does not allow
me to navigate whatever I am viewing with <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>,
<kbd>k</kbd>, and <kbd>l</kbd>, so I set out to find a workaround for this.

Here's what you need to do:

- Open "System Preferences", go to "Keyboard" and then "Shortcuts".
- From there, you go to "Application Shortcuts", and then you add two new
  shortcuts both for Preview.app by clicking the + sign.
- Since you cannot map <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> solely, I use
  <kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> instead as
  my keyboard shortcuts. The commands for the shortcuts are "Down" and "Up"
  respectively.

Good luck!
